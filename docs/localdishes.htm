            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is known as "çiğbörek" in general, this delicious dish, which is actually called "çibörek", is the most beautiful contribution of Crimean Tatars to Eskişehir. It consists of combination of onion, mincemeat, dough and various spices. Almost every restaurant in Eskişehir offers different kinds of çibörek with different materials. We strongly recommend tasting it with yoghurt or salted sauces.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the most famous dessert in the city containing flour, sugar, lemon, oil and water. It is very difficult to make this delicious dessert which is enriched with various nuts or cocoa. That's why it would be good to taste this excellence from the places where real masters work instead of doing it at home for a good meal.
